# DSInject

Injector for Nintendo DS Wii U Virtual Console.

DSInject was born as a project derived from [64Inject](https://github.com/phacoxcll/64Inject) and I inherit some of the bad programming practices from the origins of 64Inject (especially in error handling) so I do not recommend the use of this code.

I used 64Inject as a base to create [Phacox's Injector](https://github.com/phacoxcll/PhacoxsInjector) by changing a lot of code to improve error handling and incorporate more "injectors". That is why I have abandoned the development of DSInject in favor of Phacox's Injector which retains the same functionality and adds many more for other Wii U Virtual Consoles.
